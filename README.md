# Personal-Budget-Tracker-Application
Students will develop a personal budget tracker application that allows users to: 1) Add, update, and delete financial transactions (income and expenses). 2) Categorize transactions (e.g., Income, Food, Bills, Entertainment). 3) View their current financial balance. 4) Filter and sort transactions by category, type, or date.
